## Detailed Summary for NLTK Book Chapter 9: Building Feature-Based Grammars

### 9.1 Grammatical Features
- Introduces feature structures as a way to represent grammatical information (e.g., number, gender, person, tense) in a structured, attribute-value format.
- Explains agreement (e.g., subject-verb agreement), subcategorization (e.g., verb argument structure), and other grammatical features (e.g., case, definiteness).
- Example: Representing a noun phrase with features: `[NUM: plural, GENDER: feminine]`.
- Example: Using features to enforce agreement in parsing (e.g., "the dogs run" vs. "the dog runs").

### 9.2 Processing Feature Structures
- Shows how to define and process feature-based grammars in NLTK using `nltk.FeatStruct`, `nltk.FeatureGrammar`, and related tools.
- Demonstrates unification: combining feature structures and checking for compatibility (e.g., enforcing agreement between subject and verb).
- Example: Defining a feature-based grammar in NLTK and parsing sentences with agreement constraints.
- Example: Using unification to resolve feature values during parsing.

### 9.3 Exercises and Applications
- Practice defining feature structures for different parts of speech and grammatical phenomena.
- Write and parse sentences with feature-based grammars, enforcing agreement and subcategorization constraints.
- Experiment with unification and feature checking in parsing complex sentences.
- Apply feature-based grammars to improve parsing accuracy and handle linguistic variation.
