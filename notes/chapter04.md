## Detailed Summary for NLTK Book Chapter 4: Writing Structured Programs

### 4.1 Back to the Basics
- Reviews Python assignment, equality, and conditionals.
- Explains the difference between value equality (`==`) and object identity (`is`).
- Discusses truthiness and Boolean context in Python (e.g., empty lists/strings are `False`).
```python
# Value equality vs. object identity
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # True
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # False

# Using all() and any() for evaluating conditions
all([True, True, False])  # False
any([False, False, True])  # True
```

### 4.2 Sequences
- Introduces tuples, lists, and sequence operations (indexing, slicing, concatenation, iteration).
- Shows how to use `zip`, `enumerate`, and generator expressions for efficient sequence processing.
- Discusses the difference between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples, strings) sequences.
```python
words = ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']
tags = ['noun', 'verb', 'prep', 'det', 'noun']
# Pair words with tags
list(zip(words, tags))
# Sorting words by length
sorted(words, key=len)
```

### 4.3 Questions of Style
- Covers Python coding style and best practices (PEP 8).
- Compares procedural (step-by-step) and declarative (what, not how) programming styles.
- Emphasizes code readability, consistency, and maintainability.
```python
# List comprehension for clarity
squared = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### 4.4 Functions: The Foundation of Structured Programming
- Explains how to define and use functions in Python (`def my_function(args): ...`).
- Discusses parameter passing (by value/reference), scope (local/global), and return values.
- Shows how to document and decompose code using functions and docstrings.
```python
def lexical_diversity(text):
    """Calculate lexical diversity of a text."""
    return len(set(text)) / len(text)

# Using help() and docstrings
help(lexical_diversity)
```

### 4.5 Doing More with Functions
- Introduces higher-order functions (functions as arguments/return values), functions as arguments, and accumulative functions.
- Covers the use of `filter`, `map`, and `lambda` for functional programming.
```python
# Map and filter examples
list(map(len, words))  # Length of each word
list(filter(lambda w: w.isalpha(), words))  # Only alphabetic words

# Named arguments, *args, and **kwargs
def repeat(msg='<empty>', num=1):
    return msg * num
repeat('Hi', 3)
```

### 4.6 Program Development and Algorithm Design
- Explains the process of developing, testing, and documenting Python programs.
- Discusses algorithm design, decomposition, and code reuse.
- Emphasizes the importance of clear documentation and modular code.
```python
# Breaking a large task into smaller functions
# Writing tests and using assertions
assert lexical_diversity(['a', 'b', 'a']) == 2/3

# Safe file handling
with open('file.txt') as f:
    data = f.read()
```

### 4.7 Exercises and Applications
- Practice writing and using functions for text analysis.
- Use sequence operations to process and analyze lists of words or sentences.
- Refactor code for clarity, modularity, and reusability.
- Write and document utility functions for common NLP tasks.
