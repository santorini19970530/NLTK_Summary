## Summary for NLTK Book Chapter 2

1. A text corpus is a large, structured collection of texts. NLTK comes with many corpora, e.g., the Brown Corpus, nltk.corpus.brown.

2. Some text corpora are categorized, e.g., by genre or topic; sometimes the categories of a corpus overlap each other.

3. A conditional frequency distribution is a collection of frequency distributions, each one for a different condition.
   They can be used for counting word frequencies, given a context or a genre.

4. Python programs more than a few lines long should be entered using a text editor, saved to a file with a .py extension, and accessed using an `import` statement.

5. Python functions permit you to associate a name with a particular block of code, and re-use that code as often as necessary.

6. Some functions, known as "methods", are associated with an object and we give the object name followed by a period followed by the function, like this: `x.funct(y)`, e.g., `word.isalpha()`.

7. To find out about some variable `v`, type `help(v)` in the Python interactive interpreter to read the help entry for this kind of object.

8. WordNet is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English, consisting of synonym sets — or synsets — and organized into a network.

9. Some functions are not available by default, but must be accessed using Python's `import` statement.
