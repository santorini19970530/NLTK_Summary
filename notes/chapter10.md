## Detailed Summary for NLTK Book Chapter 10: Analyzing the Meaning of Sentences

### 10.1 The Challenge of Semantic Analysis
- Introduces the challenges of representing and analyzing meaning in natural language, including ambiguity, context, and world knowledge.
- Discusses the limits of formal semantics and the need for computational models that can handle real-world language use.
- Example: Ambiguous sentences with multiple possible interpretations (e.g., "Visiting relatives can be boring").

### 10.2 Representing Meaning
- Explains logical forms (predicate logic), lambda calculus, and other meaning representations used in computational semantics.
- Shows how to build and manipulate semantic representations in NLTK, including semantic parsing and evaluation.
- Example: Representing "every man loves a woman" as `forall x. man(x) -> exists y. woman(y) & loves(x, y)`.
- Example: Using lambda expressions to represent functions and variable binding in meaning composition.

### 10.3 Semantic Composition and Thematic Roles
- Discusses how meaning is composed from syntactic structure using compositional semantics.
- Introduces thematic roles (agent, patient, experiencer, etc.) and their use in semantic analysis to capture "who did what to whom".
- Example: Assigning roles in "John gave Mary a book" (agent: John, recipient: Mary, theme: book).
- Example: Using NLTK to extract and represent thematic roles from parsed sentences.

### 10.4 Exercises and Applications
- Practice representing sentences in predicate logic and lambda calculus.
- Build and evaluate semantic representations for ambiguous or complex sentences.
- Extract thematic roles from parsed sentences and analyze their relationships.
- Apply semantic analysis to tasks such as question answering or information extraction.
